# MLKit-Spotify-Artist-Name-Scanner

Authors: Colin Best and Jarred Brown


The project is a Kotlin based MLKit application which can scan text from an image and after pressing a button to go to a new activity, then search the Spotify Web-API for artists related to the text. 

Upon receiving the information from the API it will display every artist's first photograph associated with their information, name, and number of followers.

There are two ways to get an image. The first is to use your phone's camera to take a photograph, and the other is to choose one from your phone's gallery.

## Running the App

Build it and run it with Android Studio

**Note: if ran in an emulator it will crash, use a physical android phone if available.**

Some libraries used in this project are MLKit, Camerax, Picasso, CardView, RecyclerView, spotify-web-api-kotlin
